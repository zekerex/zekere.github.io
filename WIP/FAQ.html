    <h2>Can I use the assets you created for your site for my own?</h2>
    <p>Unless they are free to use graphics located at <a href="/graphix.html">the graphics page</a>, please don't use assets that I have created for my site for your own.
    <ul><li>
        You are free to make assets to a similar style to mine, I am not an "art style cop."
    </li></ul>

    <h2>Your art / music / etc... is cool! will you ever do commissions?</h2>
    <p>Art is a deep passion of mine and it comes from my heart- doing it for another person is a whole other story. I have done 
        commissions before but they are not fufilling for me. I would much rather create for myself. If I ever take on something that's 
        not my own, it's most likely because it comes from a place of passion; I am very particular.</p>

    <p>Most if not all of the assets and code on my website was created by me, <span class="gern">Radiation</span>,
        however, there are a few things that I
        have not made myself that I have made an effort to compile and credit <b>here</b>.</p>

    <h2>Graphics:</h2>
    <i>
        <p>I am using every graphic listed here under FAIR USE. Additionally, this is a personal site, and I am not
            making a profit off of anything I host here.</p>

    <div class="chunk">
        <h3>Sprites:</h3>

        <p>I have used sprites ripped from various games on a few pages on my site:</p>

        <ul>
            <li class="header"><i>Pokemon</i> and <i>Super Mario</i> rightfully belongs to Nintendo.
                <ul class="muted sublist">
                    <li>Most of the pokemon sprites were taken from <i>Pokemon: Black and White</i> and its sequels.
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>With the exception of a few sprites (i.e:
                            Yveltal and Mega Rayquaza) which are from <i>Pokemon: X and Y</i> and <i>Pokemon: Omega Ruby
                                and Alpha sapphire</i> respectively.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>The Mario sprites are from the <i>Mario and Luigi</i> series of games.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li class="header"><i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i> belongs to SEGA.
                <ul class="muted sublist">
                    <li>Most of the sprites used are from the Gensis games, such as <i>Sonic 3 (and Knuckles)</i>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="header">Digimon belongs to BANDAI.
                <ul class="muted sublist">
                    <li>I don't exactly know the source of the sprites used, even though I did my research; either way,
                        the characters are undeniably
                        <i>Digimon</i> characters, so I felt the need to put this here regardless.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Regarding Graphics from the "Old Web"</h3>
    <p>Graphics from the earlier ages of the internet (I am mainly referring to the Web 1.0 era of the internet) are not
        exactly the easiest things to source. If there <i>is</i> a clear source to any of them, I will
        list them here (for now there is nothing to list). Most of the graphics I use on this page that are from this
        period were found on <a href="https://gifcities.org/">Gifcities</a>.</p>
